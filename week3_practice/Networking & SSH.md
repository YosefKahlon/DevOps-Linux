<details>
<summary> Basic IP & Port Exploration  </summary>



To view your local IP address:
```bash
ifconfig
```
Quickly displays all listening TCP and UDP ports on the system without resolving names, providing a fast and clear view of active network sockets.
```bash
ss -tuln
```

`127.0.0.1:22` means the SSH service is listening on port 22,
but only accepts connections from the local machine (localhost).
127.0.0.1 is the loopback IP, and 22 is the default SSH port.

<summary> Generate SSH Key & Connect  </summary>
 

The `ssh-keygen` command is used to create an SSH key pair:

- üîê **Private key** ‚Äì stays on your local machine
- üîì **Public key** ‚Äì copied to the remote server

These keys allow secure, passwordless authentication over SSH.

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

Creating an RSA key
- `-t rsa` = Specifies the type of key to generate
- `-b 4096` =  Sets the strength of the key to 4096 bits
- `-f` =  Defines the file path and name to save the key
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

#### We can continue after completing the [Create Azure VM (UI or CLI)](#create-azure-vm-ui-or-cli) task.


Use `ssh-copy-id` (or manual `scp`) to copy your public key to a remote VM. 

```az
ssh yosef@<vm-ip>
```
To Connect to the VM we using the `ssh`

```az
ssh yosef@<vm-ip>
```

<details>
<summary> Create Azure VM (UI or CLI)  </summary>

 
Before creating a virtual machine, we need to create a new resource group that will contain the VM:

```bash
az login --tenant `TENANT_ID`

az group create --name vm-rg --location westeurope
```

Now we can create the virtual machine:



```bash
az vm create \
>   --resource-group vm-rg \
>   --name myLinuxVM \
>   --image Ubuntu2204 \
min-user>   --admin-username yosef \
>   --authentication-type ssh \
>   --ssh-key-values "$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)" \
->   --size Standard_B1s \
>   --location westeurope
```

Once the VM is created, we should verify that SSH (port 22) is open.
Use the following command to list all NSG (Network Security Group) rules:

```bash
az network nsg rule list \
esource->   --resource-group vm-rg \
>   --nsg-name myLinuxVMNSG \
>   --output table
```

<details>
<summary> Remote File Transfer with SCP   </summary>



To transfer files between your **local machine** and the **VM**, we use the `scp` (Secure Copy) command.  
It works over SSH and allows both uploading and downloading files securely.

---

Create a dummy file on your **local machine**:
```bash
echo "Hello from my machine!" > myfile.txt
```
Upload the file to your VM:
```bash
scp myfile.txt yosef@<vm-ip>:/home/yosef/
```


Create a local folder to download into:
```bash
mkdir downloads
```

Download the file back from the VM:
```bash
scp yosef@<vm-ip>:/home/yosef/myfile.txt ./downloads/
```
Verify On your local machine:
```bash
cat downloads/myfile.txt
```

Verify On the VM:
```bash
cat ~/myfile.txt
```

<details>
<summary> Run a Remote Command via SSH </summary>
 

To run a command remotely without logging in manually, use the `ssh -t` command:



```bash
ssh -t yosef@<vm-ip> "uptime"
ssh -t yosef@<vm-ip> "df -h"
ssh -t yosef@<vm-ip> "ls -l /home/yosef"
```
Redirecting the output to a local file

```bash
ssh -t yosef@<vm-ip> "df -h"> vm_disk_usage.txt
```
